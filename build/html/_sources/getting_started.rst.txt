Installation
------------

To use the Seldonian Engine, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install seldonian-engine

If you want to visualize the parse tree graphs, a system-wide installation of `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/download/>`_ is required.

Simple example
--------------
Consider a simple supervised regression problem with two continous random variables X and Y. Our goal is to predict label Y using the single feature X. To solve this problem we could use univariate linear regression with an objective function of the mean squared error (MSE). We can find the optimal solution to this problem by minimizing the objective function w.r.t. to the weights of the model, :math:`{\theta}`, which in this case are just the intercept and slope of the line.

Now let's suppose we want to add the following constraint into the problem: the MSE is less than 2.0, and we want to enforce this with a probability of 0.95. This is now a Seldonian machine learning problem. We now have all of the high level information we need to solve the problem using the engine!

To code this up as a real example using the engine, we need to:

- Define the data - we'll need to generate some synthetic data 
- Define the metadata - in this case just the column names
- Put data and metadata together into a DataSet object
- Define the behavioral constraint (constraint string and confidence level)
- Make the parse tree from this behavioral constraint
- Define the underlying machine learning model and primary objective 
- Define an initial solution function which takes the features and labels as inputs and outputs an initial solution theta vector - in this case we will use the :code:`fit()` method of the model object.
- Create a spec object containing all of this information and some hyperparameters - we can mostly use the defaults
- Run the Seldonian algorithm using the spec object

Let's write out the code to do this:

.. code::

        # Set y to be x, plus noise from a standard normal distribution
        Y = X + np.random.normal(loc_Y, sigma_Y, numPoints) 
        return (X,Y)
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        np.random.seed(0)

        df = pd.DataFrame(rows,columns=columns)

        dataset = SupervisedDataSet(df,
            meta_information=columns,
            label_column='label',
            include_intercept_term=True)

        constraint_strs = ['Mean_Squared_Error - 2.0']
        deltas = [0.05] # confidence levels

        # Make the parse tree from this behavioral constraint

        parse_trees = []
        for ii in range(len(constraint_strs)):
            constraint_str = constraint_strs[ii]

            delta = deltas[ii]

            # Create parse tree object
            parse_tree = ParseTree(
                delta=delta,
                regime='supervised',

        # Define the underlying machine learning model  
        model_class = LinearRegressionModel

        # Define the primary objective, the MSE

        # Define initial solution function

        spec = SupervisedSpec(
            dataset=dataset,

            parse_trees=parse_trees,
        )

        # Run seldonian algorithm
        passed_safety,candidate_solution = seldonian_algorithm(spec)
        print(passed_safety,candidate_solution)

In order to use the engine to enforce this constraint, we need to write this constraint function as a constraint string. The constraint string is:



We also need to supply a :term:`confidence level<Confidence level>`, :math:`{\delta}`, for this constraint. Let's use a value of :math:`{\delta}=0.05`, so that the constraint is enforced with a probability of :math:`1-{\delta}=0.95`. 
    


what datasets and constraints we want to use. We will use the command line interface (CLI) in this example, specifically the supervised learning CLI.

Looking at the documentation for :py:mod:`.cli_supervised`, we can see the usage is:

 .. code-block:: console

     $ python interface.py data_pth metadata_pth
     [--include_sensitive_columns] 
     [--include_intercept_term]
     [--save_dir]

The two required arguments are :code:`data_pth`, the path to the data file and :code:`metadata_pth`, the path to the metadata file. The data and metadata files for this example can be downloaded from the source code repository on `GitHub <https://github.com/seldonian-framework/Engine/tree/main/static/datasets/GPA>`_. The other arguments are optional, but we will want to use
